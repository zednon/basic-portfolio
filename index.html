<h2 class="aboutme">About Me</h2>
<p class="mybio">I started using a computer when I was 2, some of my earlist memories include Sticky Bear Type, Logo, and run jump. Clearly I went into computer right? after making websites on GeoCities to hold my Mp3's in high school. I followed the path of a history major. After 10 years of working as Employment Counlor for Disabled people I relized which board games I was doing an amazing job and winning at. I relized I should look at computer coding. </p>
